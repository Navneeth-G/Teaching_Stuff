### Reversing Values in a Column Based on Custom Sorting Logic (SQL)
### ðŸ§© **Problem Statement**

Given a table with ProductID, Product, and Category, 
we need to reassign ProductID values within each category, such that:

- The new ProductIDs are the reverse of the original ProductIDs (within that category),
- The rows themselves (Product name + Category) remain unchanged.


**Input Table Example:**

| ProductID | Product    | Category    |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | Laptop     | Electronics |
| 2         | Smartphone | Electronics |
| 3         | Tablet     | Electronics |
| 9         | Printer    | Electronics |
| 4         | Headphones | Accessories |
| 5         | Smartwatch | Accessories |
| 6         | Keyboard   | Accessories |
| 7         | Mouse      | Accessories |
| 8         | Monitor    | Accessories |


**Expected Output Example:**

| ProductID | Product    | Category    |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 9         | Laptop     | Electronics |
| 3         | Smartphone | Electronics |
| 2         | Tablet     | Electronics |
| 1         | Printer    | Electronics |
| 8         | Headphones | Accessories |
| 7         | Smartwatch | Accessories |
| 6         | Keyboard   | Accessories |
| 5         | Mouse      | Accessories |
| 4         | Monitor    | Accessories |

### ðŸ’¡ **Hints Before Jumping In**


- You're not just sorting rows.
- You're reassigning column values â€” this requires mapping.
- The reassignment is **relative to the position** within a group.

### ðŸ§  **Thought Process & Step-by-Step Reasoning**


#### Step 1: Whatâ€™s Really Changing?
Weâ€™re not sorting rows. Weâ€™re assigning new values to `ProductID`.

#### Step 2: Whatâ€™s the Partition Group?
Each category needs to be treated independently â†’ use `PARTITION BY Category`.

#### Step 3: Whatâ€™s the Rule?
Sort all ProductIDs in ascending order, and assign the reversed values back as NewProductID.

#### Step 4: How to Assign Position?
Use `ROW_NUMBER()`:
- Once for ascending order
- Once for descending order

#### Step 5: Join Those Two Together
This lets us map each position from ascending to its counterpart in descending.


### ðŸ”„ **SQL Solution**

```sql
WITH ranked_products AS (
  SELECT 
    ProductID,
    Product,
    Category,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY ProductID ASC) AS rn
  FROM products
),
reversed_ids AS (
  SELECT 
    ProductID AS reversed_id,
    Category,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY ProductID DESC) AS rn
  FROM products
)
SELECT 
  r.ProductID AS Original_ProductID,
  r.Product,
  r.Category,
  rev.reversed_id AS NewProductID
FROM ranked_products r
JOIN reversed_ids rev
  ON r.Category = rev.Category AND r.rn = rev.rn
ORDER BY NewProductID DESC;
```

### ðŸ§ª **Table Transformations at Each Step**

You can paste in screenshots or markdown tables from earlier like:

#### âž¤ ranked\_products (row number ascending):

| ProductID | Product    | Category    |   rn |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|
| 1         | Laptop     | Electronics |    1 |
| 2         | Smartphone | Electronics |    2 |
| 3         | Tablet     | Electronics |    3 |
| 9         | Printer    | Electronics |    4 |
| 4         | Headphones | Accessories |    1 |
| 5         | Smartwatch | Accessories |    2 |
| 6         | Keyboard   | Accessories |    3 |
| 7         | Mouse      | Accessories |    4 |
| 8         | Monitor    | Accessories |    5 |


#### âž¤ reversed\_ids (row number descending):

| reversed_id | Product    | Category    |   rn |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|------|
| 1           | Laptop     | Electronics |    4 |
| 2           | Smartphone | Electronics |    3 |
| 3           | Tablet     | Electronics |    2 |
| 9           | Printer    | Electronics |    1 |

| 8           | Monitor    | Accessories |    1 |


#### âž¤ Final joined result:

| Original_ProductID | Product    | Category    | rn | rn_of_rev | Original_ProductID_of_rev | Product_of_rev | Category_of_rev | NewProductID |
