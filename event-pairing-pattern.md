# Event Pairing in SQL üìù

## How to Recognize
- Table has pairs of events in separate rows (start/end timestamps)
- Need to match these pairs to calculate something (like duration)
- Keywords: start/end, in/out, before/after

## Two Ways to Solve

### 1. SELF JOIN Method ü§ù
```sql
SELECT s.id, (e.time - s.time) as duration
FROM events s 
JOIN events e 
  ON s.id = e.id 
  AND s.type = 'start' 
  AND e.type = 'end'
```
Think: "Match each start with its end"

### 2. Aggregation Method üìä
```sql
SELECT id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN type = 'end' THEN time END) -
    MIN(CASE WHEN type = 'start' THEN time END) as duration
FROM events
GROUP BY id
```
Think: "Group events and pick start/end times"

# When to Use Which Method

### 1. Use SELF JOIN When:
```sql
-- If you need details from both start AND end events
SELECT 
    s.id,
    s.user_name,      -- start event details
    s.location_start, -- start event details
    e.location_end,   -- end event details
    e.battery_level,  -- end event details
    (e.time - s.time) as duration
FROM events s 
JOIN events e 
    ON s.id = e.id 
    AND s.type = 'start' 
    AND e.type = 'end'
```
Think: "I need info from BOTH start and end rows"

### 2. Use Aggregation When:
```sql
-- If you just need the time difference or simple calculations
SELECT 
    id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN type = 'end' THEN time END) -
    MIN(CASE WHEN type = 'start' THEN time END) as duration
FROM events
GROUP BY id
```
Think: "I just need to calculate differences"

### Real Example:
1. Ride-sharing app:
   - JOIN Method: Need rider's pickup location AND dropoff location
   - Aggregate Method: Just need to calculate ride duration

2. Factory process:
   - JOIN Method: Need operator name at start AND error codes at end

## Real-World Examples
1. Process Monitoring
   - Track process start/end times
   - Calculate process duration

2. User Sessions
   - Track login/logout
   - Calculate session length

3. Delivery Tracking
   - Track pickup/delivery
   - Calculate transit time

## Common Gotchas
- Ensure proper join conditions
- Handle NULL values appropriately
- Consider data type casting
- Watch for duplicate events

The key is:
- Need multiple columns from both events? ‚Üí Use JOIN
- Just need time difference? ‚Üí Use Aggregate
